# DevOps

A view on many variations.

# Many variations

----

# "One Team"

Developers and operators are in one team.

```
+----------+
| :-)  :-) |
| DEV  OPS |
+----------+
```

----

# "Scrummaster"

Teams have a scrummaster.

```
+----------------------+
| :-|  :-|     :-)     |
| ???  ??? SCRUMMASTER |
+----------------------+
```

----

# "Split responsibilities"

- Developers mananage "dev", "tst" & "acc".
- Operators manage "prd".

```
  +-----+    +-----+
  | :-| |    | :-| |
  | DEV |    | OPS |
  +-----+    +-----+
     |         |
dev,tst,acc   prod
```

----

# "Completely split"

There are teams called "Dev" and other teams called "Ops".

```
  +-DEV-+    +-OPS-+
  | :-| |    | :-| |
  | ??? |    | ??? |
  +-----+    +-----+
```

----

# "Modern tooling"

We use Terraform & Ansible so we are DevOps.

```
+-----------+
| :-|  :-|  |
| ???  ???  |
| ANSIBLE   |
| TERRAFORM |
+-----------+
```

----

# "No handovers"

A team can work on d, t, a & p.

----

# "No Ops please"

I don't feel like operations, let's DevOps and never pickup the phone anymore.

```
         +-OPS-+   +-DEV-+
WORK ->  | :-| |   | :-) |
         +-----+   +-----+
```

----

# "Dev" role and "Ops" role

- Dev can create builds
- Ops can release

```
+-DEV-+   +-OPS-+
| :-| |   | :-| |
+-----+   +-----+

BUILD  ->  RELEASE

# Agile VS DevOps

# Agile

We don't plan, it's Agile.

# Architects

What is the role of an Architect in DevOps?

---

# DevOps

- Is culture
- Have a single responsibility

---

# ! DevOps

- Infra as Code
- To automate operations

---

# Developers

## Write code that's

- shippable as bytecode
- runs autonomously

---

# Dev VS Ops

1. Developers are nobel
2. Operators clean up

---

# DevOps at scale

Is that even possible?

- The hardware/datacenter department
- The infra department

---

# My conclusion

In a true devops organization, everybody can contribute to all* code.

## ALL
- application
- ci
- deployment
- maintenance
