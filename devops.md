# Many variations

Developers and operators are in one team.

Teams have a scrummaster.

There are teams called "Dev" and other teams called "Ops".

----

# "Modern tooling"

We use Terraform & Ansible so we are DevOps.

----

# "No handovers"

A team can work on d, t, a & p.

----

# "No Ops please"

I don't feel like operations, let's DevOps and never pickup the phone anymore.

1. Developers are better
