# Photography basics

follow along: http://robertdebock/presentations/

A little technical, buy hopefully barely sufficient.

---

# ISO

Sensitivity of the sensor/film.

<img height="70%" width="70%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertdebock/presentations/master/content/images/iso.png"/>

----

# ISO Low

- ISO 100, ISO 200.
- A "clean" image.

----

# ISO High

- ISO 3200, ISO 6400.
- Useful in "dark" situations.

----

# ISO examples

---

# Shutter

Controls the time light exposes the sensor/film.

<img height="70%" width="70%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertdebock/presentations/master/content/images/shutter.png"/>

----

# Fast shutter

- 1/500, 1/1000.
- Freezes the image.

----

# Slow shutter

- 1/1, 1/2.
- Lets in loads of photons.
- Displays motion as blur.

----

---

# Aperture 

The size of the opening in the lens.

<img height="70%" width="70%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertdebock/presentations/master/content/images/aperture.png"/>

----

# Aperture small

- f/22, f/16
- Large depth of field.
- Reduce the amount of photons.

----

# Aperture large

- f/1.4, f/2.8
- Narrow depth of field.
- Lets in loads of photons.

# Same exposure

- ISO: 400, 1/125, f/8
- ISO: 400, 1/60, f/11
- ISO: 200, 1/60, f/8
- ISO: 100, 1/30, f/8

# Question

My image is not sharp with these settings, what to do?

- ISO: 200
- f/11
- 1/15

----

# Bonus question

My image is not sharp with these settings, what to do?

- ISO: 6400
- f/2.0
- 1/15

# Choose

When you have sufficient light, you can choose. When it's too dark, you're out of options.

---

# Preferences

----

## Scenarios
- Portraits: Wide aperature (f/1.4)
- Landscape: Small aperarure (f/11)
- Sports: Fast shutter (1/1000)
- Food: Depends

---

# Food preference

- ISO: as low as possible (ISO 200)
- Shutter handheld: 1/60 - 1/125
- Shutter tripod: As slow as necessary
- Aperture flatlay: f/5.6 - f/8
- Aperture 45 degrees: quite open (f/1.4)

----

# Food: ISO

## As low as possible

There is no need for a high ISO, so as low as possible.

```
ISO: 200
```

----

# Food: shutter

## As fast as required.

Food photography is a very controlled type of environment. Choose a speeds that reduces camera/shutter shake.

```
Shutter: 1/60
```

----

# Food: aperture

## Aperture flatlay: enough to get everything in focus.

There is no reason for a shallow depth of field on a flatlay. [Choose](http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html) an aperture that gets everything in focus. (f/8)

```
Aperture: f/5.6
```

----

# Food: aperture

## Aperture 45 degrees: open so the background blurs.

To get an atmosphere, an open aperture (f/1.4, f/2.8) can help. You may need to line up your subjects into the focus area.

```
Aperture: f/2.0
```

# Others

- Whitebalance
- RAW/jpeg
- Focus settings

# Final hint

Understand the settings, but above all:

## Look at the result.
