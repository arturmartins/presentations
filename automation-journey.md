# What to automate

1. Make a list of job.
2. Rate job for "frequent" and "automation effort".
3. Decide.
4. CODE!

----

# List of jobs

- Applying patches
- Disk expansions
- Install component x
- Update component x
- Remove component x

----

# Rate jobs

1: not frequent, low effort
10: super frequent, high effort
